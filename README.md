# Huchback-Demo
Just a little C64 sprite demo. Code help courtesy Old Skool Coder, graphics and sprites all created by myself. 


I had been struggling sometime with pointers for sprites on the c64. In fact i was struggling with sprites full stop, couldn’t even understand how to add an overlay sprite to another.  

Thankfully a night in shining armour came to my rescue in the form of OldSkoolCoder. Check him out on here as well as Twitch and You Tube.  He took time out to complete as live coding session on his Twitch channel to nail sprites. You can check the video out via the link here  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/666210638  .

The code you see here is down to his help and skills, by talking through the process I got the gist of the three rules and am now able to code sprites to the c64 (when I say code I could before, but he helped me understand what to do).


I hope the video will help others also.  There are tons of sources out there to help code in assembly for the c64. Enjoy
